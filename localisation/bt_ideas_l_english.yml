 SYR_ideas: "Syrian Ideas"
 SYR_ideas_start: "Syrian Traditions"
 SYR_ideas_bonus: "Syrian Ambition"
 SYR_ancient_history: "Ancient History"
 SYR_ancient_history_desc: "The region where Syria inhabits has been a haven for ancient cultures. The Phoenicians, the Canaanites, the Egyptians at one point, the Greeks at other points, so many people have lent their knowledge and legacy to the Syrian people over the years that we would be fools not to use them to our advantage today."
 SYR_levantine_value: "Levantine Value"
 SYR_levantine_value_desc: "The great value present within the Levant is not secret to those from Europe, Persia, Arabia, North Africa, and many other places. With Syria in a prime position to take hold of the entirety of the Levant, we are set to be in a prime position for negotiations in the future. Access to the Levant is key not just for trade, but for some religions as well."
 SYR_rashidun_umayyad_abbasid_caliphates: "The Caliphates"
 SYR_rashidun_umayyad_abbasid_caliphates_desc: "From the Rashidun to the Umayyad to the Abbasid Caliphate, Syrian land has been the subject of Islamic conquest and integration for several centuries now. It is through the Caliphates and the intermediate powers that came between them and after them that Syria has learned to fight and become a force to be reckoned with."
 SYR_crusader_memories: "Crusader Memories"
 SYR_crusader_memories_desc: "The crusades of centuries past left a considerable mark upon Syrian history. The bastions they built up along with the conflicts they fought in the Levant and on Syrian land are remembered well by our people, but our people would be fools to only tell the tales of the crusades and not learn from them. Using what they left behind and engineering tight and sound defensive structures like they did will allow us to withstand invasion after invasion."
 SYR_internal_cohesion: "Internal Cohesion"
 SYR_internal_cohesion_desc: "Various tensions within Syria pull at the edges, seeking to stretch it to its breaking point. Whether it is ethnic unrest, religious strife, or possibly even monetary trouble, Syria must remain cohesive and ready to handle these problems as they come along."
 SYR_ethnicities_in_and_around_syria: "People Groups of Syria"
 SYR_ethnicities_in_and_around_syria_desc: "There are several people coming and going from Syria, some whom choose to settle in the land. They bring their culture, language, and traditions to Syria and as such also bring in bouts of tension at times as their interests may conflict with Syrian interests. We must, over time, learn to accept these new people as our own and to integrate them into Syria so that we may flourish without worry."
 SYR_syria_as_a_nation: "The Nation of Syria"
 SYR_syria_as_a_nation_desc: "A unified Syrian nation is a dream many administrators of ours have. The royalty, the nobility, and even a good portion of the peasants have come to us with lofty goals of living in a strong and secure Syrian nation, but do we have the resources to make this dream a reality? If we do not have it internally, we must take it from external sources, and for that, we will form a better and larger military."
 
 IRQ_ideas: "Iraqi Ideas"
 IRQ_ideas_start: "Iraqi Traditions"
 IRQ_ideas_bouns: "Iraqi Ambition"
 IRQ_defense_of_mesopotamia: "Defend Mesopotamia"
 IRQ_defense_of_mesopotamia_desc: "The value in Mesopotamia is vast and great and most every person in the regions around us know this very well. As such, they will be striving to subjugate Iraqi lands in any way they can, keeping the resources harvested from here for themselves. Thus, it is our mission to defend the land to our greatest ability and to fortify ourselves against all threats, rising to the challenge of invasions whenever they occur."
 IRQ_cradle_of_great_cities: "Cradle of Great Cities"
 IRQ_cradle_of_great_cities_desc: "The great ancient cities like Assur and Babylonia still retain remnants in Mesopotamia, despite them being faint as of today. Our preservation and respect for them, however, had led us to them being visited more often and our nation being regarded as a keeper of the past and one that learns from its previous mistakes and builds upon them to make a better and brighter future."
 IRQ_fortify_iraqi_lands: "Fortify Iraqi Lands"
 IRQ_fortify_iraqi_lands_desc: "The lands of Iraq are open and offer plenty of routes into and out of their streets and pathways. It is in our best interest to see these places better defended and better built in terms of their defensive status, so as to deter invaders from coming through."
 IRQ_persian_influences: "Persian Influences"
 IRQ_persian_influences_desc: "The Persians beyond the mountains to our east have often been in contact with the people of Iraq and often times they bring with them great ideas and trade opportunities. Perhaps recruiting more into our court could elevate it to a higher standard than before? It is well worth a try since our predecessors have and they too prospered from it."
 IRQ_trade_links_of_mesopotamia: "Trade Links of Mesopotamia"
 IRQ_trade_links_of_mesopotamia_desc: "Trade flows in and out of Mesopotamia regularly and it is quite prosperous on its own. By taking it into our own hands more so than before and inserting our influence where possible, we will profit from Mesopotamian trade routes at an unprecedented rate."
 IRQ_establish_military_framework: "Establish Military Framework"
 IRQ_establish_military_framework_desc: "In order to keep Iraq from sinking into the past of military history, we will need to design a proper military framework that we can follow and possibly reform in the future. By doing so, Iraq will be able to keep itself up-to-date with the latest in military thought and strategy and will not be so easily subdued by others."
 IRQ_behold_al_iraq: "Behold, al-Iraq"
 IRQ_behold_al_iraq_desc: "Before, there was little hope of a true Iraqi nation. But with our strength and skill, we are well on the way toward providing a safe haven for people who consider themselves 'Iraqi' and who want to see a prospering and grand Iraqi nation. Let us continue to work toward this goal, despite what seeks to hold us back."

 PLS_independent_palestine:0 "Independence of Palestine"
 PLS_independent_palestine_desc:0 "Our land has been under control of tribes, Kingdoms Empires, Caliphates, but finally, authority rests firmly in our hands, and it is our moment to shine in history and ensure Palestine's continued prestige in the Levant. To do that, we need to maintain a strong standing army that will turn all would-be conquerors back in shame!"
 PLS_holy_land:0 "Holy Land"
 PLS_holy_land_desc:0 "Our country holds within its borders the most sacred land on the planet, the land of milk and honey.

 PLS_natural_beauty:0 "Natural Beauty"
 PLS_natural_beauty_desc:0 "Since antiquity Palestine has been known as a place of exceptional natural wealth and beauty. People come from all over the world just to see this land, with its geographical variety, we have a lot to learn from the place we call home."
 PLS_taxation_policies:0 "Taxation Policies"
 PLS_taxation_policies_desc:0 "There are people of many faiths and profession in our nation. From artisans to merchants, from bankers to scholars, there is much wealth that they can give to us, in more ways than one."
 PLS_dead_sea:0 "The Dead Sea"
 PLS_dead_sea_desc:0 "The Dead sea is of high importance to all Abrahamic religions, and even non-Abrahamic religions recognised its power, power that they attributed to magic."
 PLS_trade_crossroads:0 "Trade Crossroads"
 PLS_trade_crossroads_desc:0 "Connecting the Levant with Egypt, Palestine is an extremely important trade route. Many expensive, luxurious goods pass through here, and it is of extreme importance that we focus our efforts into controlling trade in the region."
 PLS_defend_the_merchants:0 "Defend the Merchants"
 PLS_defend_the_merchants_desc:0 "As our influence in the Mediterranean grows, we must have capable divisions of light ships in order to protect our merchants from foreign harassment. These skills will also be very important in our continued importance in the seas."
 
 YZD_ideas: "Yazdi Ideas"
 YZD_ideas_start: "Yazdi Traditions"
 YZD_ideas_bonus: "Yazdi Ambition"
 YZD_zoroastrian_legacy: "Zoroastrian Legacy"
 YZD_zoroastrian_legacy_desc: "The pious nature of the Yazdi people has been known since the time of the Sassanids. Though faiths change over time, the effort our people put into making their faith as true and as great as can be can be seen when Zoroastrianism was still dominant in Persia. Using these old traditions, we will ensure that our faith today shines as brightly as it did before."
 YZD_difficulties_of_yazd: "The Difficulties of Yazd"
 YZD_difficulties_of_yazd_desc: "Yazd is not only a difficult place to live, but it is also a difficult place to fight inside of. The isolated parts of it harbor safe passage and resources, but other those parts, people are subject to the elements around them. It is through these difficulties that we have learned to hone our shock-based desert tactics, and when we need to fight oustide of Yazd, we will be sure to adapt these tactics to the different envrironments."
 YZD_capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty: "Former Capital of the Muzaffarid Dynasty"
 YZD_capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty_desc: "The Muzaffarid Dynasty may have had but a brief life in Persia, but they had their capital at one point stationed in Yazd itself. Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."
 YZD_haven_in_persia: "Haven in Persia"
 YZD_haven_in_persia_desc: "For a long time now, we've been known as a safe haven for Persians everywhere who are fleeing persecution or are in need of respite. Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region. With this in mind, expanding outwards will be less of any issue if we continue this policy of being a safe haven for Persian people."
 YZD_silk_weaving_industry: "Silk Weaving Industry"
 YZD_silk_weaving_industry_desc: "A commodity and wondrous material, silk, is readily produced in Yazd and its patterns and production are unique to Yazd itself (or so some say). We'd prefer to keep this silk production going as strong as possible, but to also not overwhelm our people with it, so we will need to balance out how production of it will scale in the future."
 YZD_sassanian_roots: "Sassanian Roots"
 YZD_sassanian_roots_desc: "Yazd itself is named after the Shahanshah of the Sassanid Empire, Yazdegerd I. Throughout the times from the Sassanid Empire onwards, Yazd has been known as a sort of memorial or legacy place that the Sassanids left behind in their wake, and with that legitimacy backing us, we can be sure that people from around Persia will support our authority."
 YZD_uniting_persia: "Uniting Persia"
 YZD_uniting_persia_desc: "The pieces of Persia lay scattered and divided, fighting for dominance after the fall of Timur and in the face of threats from the north, west, and the east. However hard of a goal it might be to reach, the ambition to unite Persia once more under a single dynasty that is stable and righteous is what Yazd is set out to do. Time will tell if our ambition is to be fulfilled."
 
 BAR_ideas: "Barrois Ideas"
 BAR_ideas_start: "Barrois Traditions"

 sophias_power: "Sophie, Countess of Bar"
 sophias_power_desc: "From 1033 to 1093, after the death of Frederick III, Duke of Upper Lorraine, the cunning and grand Countess of Bar, Sophie, expanded the territory of Bar through various methods of political and diplomatic intrigue along with conquest and purchase. Even her descendants continued this path of expansion and brought Bar to grand prominence as a de facto independent border state betwixt the Germans and the French people. It is because of her that we owe our existence and fortune."
 french_politics_over_german_politics: "French Politics over German Politics"
 french_politics_over_german_politics_desc: "In deciding which side of the fence we'd be on, our French lineage dictated that we side with and become entrenched in French politics over German politics. As such, centuries of intermarriage and intrigue followed our choice and we have been quite prominent in our time within the French region."
 a_peer_of_france: "A Peer of France"
 a_peer_of_france_desc: "A title bestowed upon nobles of distinction in the French region, the Count of Bar was recognized as one in 1354, leading it to become even more influential throughout French lands.

 ties_to_lorraine: "Ties to Lorraine"
 ties_to_lorraine_desc: "From the outset, the Duchy of Bar has been undoubtedly tied to Lorraine and its rulers. Though they may be different from us in various ways, the marriages and links between Bar and Lorraine are key and have helped ready our administration to take on different diplomatic affairs, both inside and outside of the French region."
 using_the_status_of_duchy: "Use the status of 'Duchy'"
 using_the_status_of_duchy_desc: "Being a duchy carries weight when speaking to others in the French region and even those in neighboring regions. If we can cultivate the title and keep it legitimately tied to Bar and the Barrois people, we will be able to garner wider support within our own realm itself."
 fortify_the_lands_of_bar: "Fortify the Lands of Bar"
 fortify_the_lands_of_bar_desc: "Being initially a border state of sorts has had a inherent defensive affect on us. We have learned to defend ourselves first, before taking to attacking others, and this defenisve mentality must be promoted over time if Barrois land is to remain safe and secure. Better defensive measures will be found and implemented; the walls and garrisons of Bar will not go down without a fight fit for the ages."
 BAR_regional_trade: "Regional Trade Center"
 BAR_regional_trade_desc: "Being in such a key location as ours we can control what trade goes where over land, so if we increase the regulations and the amount of caravans we send out we may see a large increase in income from trade which will undoubtedly help preserve our autonomy."
 
 ADA_ideas: "Adal Ideas"
 ADA_ideas_start: "Adal Traditions"
 ADA_ideas_bonus: "Adal Ambition"
 founded_in_fire: "Founded in Fire"
 founded_in_fire_desc: "Our foundation comes from a time of instability and chaos after the fall of the Sultanate of Ifat fell and the Ethiopians took advantage of the situation. Our foundation in such a hectic time does not hamper our zeal, however, it only serves to strengthen our resolve for the future."
 the_eternal_rivalry: "The Eternal Rivalry"
 the_eternal_rivalry_desc: "The constant struggle for dominance in the region between us and the power that is Ethiopia seems like it will never end, or, if it does, it will be at the cost of so many lives. Still, the fact that our rival remains alive and threatening to us rallies the people of Adal to the banners of our armies, and even after all is said and done, the lessons learned from victory will keep our military strong."
 lead_the_somali_people: "Lead the Somali People"
 lead_the_somali_people_desc: "Disunited for so long, the Somali people have long deserved a strong and powerful nation that they can rally behind. Adal can and will be that nation, after the fall of Ifat."
 futuh_al_habash: "Futuh al Habash"

 control_the_afar_and_oromo: "Control the Tribes"
 control_the_afar_and_oromo_desc: "The Oromo and Afar are unruly as is, and when they become autonomous enough, they can and will become a serious threat to Adal. Action must be taken before this happens so that they may be curtailed and integrated into Adal itself."
 turning_to_trade: "Turning to Trade"
 turning_to_trade_desc: "Securing trade around South Arabia and the Red Sea isn't easy, but lucrative and well worth the effort. It is in our best interest to steer trade away from foreign ports and instead toward ports that Adal controls."
 ties_to_muslim_nations: "Ties to Muslim Nations"
 ties_to_muslim_nations_desc: "Extending our hand in friendship and cooperation to other nations under the banner of Islam is a must if we are to keep ourselves alive. Many lie up north and in Arabia and as such we will do our best to make contact with them."

 HDY_ideas_start: "Hadiya Traditions"
 HDY_ideas_bonus: "Hadiya Ambition"
 horses_of_hadiya: "Horses of Hadiya"
 horses_of_hadiya_desc: "Hadiya is a place rich in horses and other resources that are valuable for making a nation grand and worthy of surviving the test of time. With regard to horses, our land is able to cultivate a great many and use them not only for grazing purposes, but for extensive military purposes as well. We'd be foolish to not use our horses as such!"
 iron_currency: "Iron Currency"
 iron_currency_desc: "Regulating our own currency is something prestigous in its own right and we of Hadiya take pride in this. With iron being what our currency is made of, regulating it on our own and making our economy more so dependent on it as opposed to a different nation's currency will help sustain Hadiya as a whole."
 uphold_hadiya_fertility: "Hadiya Fertility"
 uphold_hadiya_fertility_desc: "The lands of Hadiya have continued to be fertile for generations without end and we are forever thankful for this. With this fertility of the land, we must use what we get from it properly by building up our towns and cities as well as our infrastructure from the ground up. Without this foundational element of Hadiya properly built up, our administration and our military will be without enough resources altogether."

 religious_wars_horn_of_africa_desc: "The battle between the Cross and the Star-and-Crescent in the Horn of Africa has been around for centuries now and there is no clear end in sight. We of Hadiya must raise the banner of Islam against the likes of Ethiopia and its cadre of subject states so that there can be peace in the region. And even after there is peace in the Horn, Hadiya must carry the legacy forth and toward other ends of Africa and beyond."
 question_of_the_oromo: "Question of the Oromo"
 question_of_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo migrations have caused a great amount of turmoil in our region but we are not so opposed to them as our neighbors to the west have been. True, the Oromo have caused tension with the Hadiya people, but they are not without their advantages if they can be negotiated with properly and integrated into a wider society as a whole."
 adal_connections: "Adal Connections"
 adal_connections_desc: "The Sultanate of Adal may not be the most friendly power to Hadiya, but they are of Sunni Islam and have pledged to help our people at times against the likes of Ethiopia itself. We can and should use our diplomatic ties inside of Adal to connect to other Islamic nations so that Hadiya is not progressively isolated."
 royal_hadiya_military: "Royal Hadiya Military"
 royal_hadiya_military_desc: "With our military heralding the success of Hadiya in its expansion and defense, formalizing it into something more professional and educating the leaders of the Hadiya military in various strategies not found necessarily in our region will provide us with a strong base for future conquests."

 JJI_ideas_start: "Janjiro Traditions"
 JJI_ideas_bonus: "Janjiro Ambition"
 horses_to_ethiopia: "Horses to Ethiopia"
 horses_to_ethiopia_desc: "In the past, we have contributed tribute to Ethiopia in the form of horses amongst other resources. We should be inclined to use some of these horses for our own military rather than giving them all to Ethiopia since they will surely get horses from other places, not just Janjiro."
 the_mwa_clan: "The Mwa Clan"
 the_mwa_clan_desc: "The Mwa Clan is the clan from where many of our leaders have been elected from and to this day they still continue be influential in our politics to this day.

 janjiros_isolation: "Janjiros Isolation"
 janjiros_isolation_desc: "Traditionally we have been isolated from several other kingdoms and states due to our location. The mountains and rivers make for nearly impassable terrain entrances into Janjiro land and it is because of this isolation that we can administrate the land much better than other places. Keeping track of communities is fairly easy and building up laws of land is also fairly easy as compared to having huge tracts of land that are hard to manage."
 no_soldier_killed_in_action: "No Soldier Lost In Battle!"
 no_soldier_killed_in_action_desc: "We must not let our enemies drip the blood of our own soldiers on our own land! Should a soldier wounded in battle come back to Janjiro, they will be given blessings by our leader and executed by their own family members. Our enemies can't claim to have killed Janjiro soldiers in battle for they are the greatest warriors around! Let our enemies taste no victory in our land!"
 control_the_raging_rivers: "Controlling the Rivers"
 control_the_raging_rivers_desc: "The rivers around us are known for keeping our heartland fairly isolated but they are not alone in trying to gain easy access across them. If we can build sufficent bridges, learn the regular changes in the flow of the rivers, or perhaps build strong enough boats to go across the rivers, we can achieve a greater amount of overall movement speed for our military and civilian population which will be useful in the future."
 contacts_with_ethiopia: "Contacts with Ethiopia"
 contacts_with_ethiopia_desc: "As we progressively come out of our isolation, what will help us greatly is our connection to Ethiopia.

 the_three_mountains: "The Three Mountains"
 the_three_mountains_desc: "Mount Bor Ama, Mount Azulu, and Mount Toba are the three traditional mountain markers of the Kingdom of Janjiro. They are our foundation, the bedrock by which we built up a secure yet isolated life; the three mountains are what continue to help give our poeple strength whether it is times of natural disasters or in times of deadly plagues.

 SOA_ideas_bonus: "Shewa Ambition"
 aksumite_heritage: "Aksumite Heritage"
 aksumite_heritage_desc: "The history of Shewa as an area of significance goes back several centuries, even back to the times of the Aksumite Empire. Let us never forget what has come before us in the form of states that have come and gone, tales of great people who travelled to and from Shewa, and prestigious people who have settled in Shewa. Their legacy is what we must cultivate as we continue on in the very same place as they were once at."
 ifat_sultanate_ties: "Ties to the Ifat Sultanate"
 ifat_sultanate_ties_desc: "Before our time, there was the Ifat Sultanate that rose to prominence in the east and expanded westward toward Shewa.

The Ifat Sultanate may be gone now, but their legacy of having a fighting spirit against their religious enemies is still imbued within the people of Shewa today."
 history_of_religious_conflict: "History of Religious Conflict"
 history_of_religious_conflict_desc: "Islam and Christianity in this region mix like water and oil, and in the realm of politics, react with flowers of fire and destruction.

We must not hide our face from it, no, we must charge at it head-on without fear of death or defeat!"

 memory_of_the_makhzumi_dynasty_desc: "There once was an independent Muslim Shewa Sultanate, back from around the 900s to upon the conquests westward by the Ifat Sultanate in the 1200s. Though the dynasty from that era, the Makhzumi, is no longer around, it's legacy lives on today in the people of our land. They strive for greatness and they uphold the dynasty properly, just as the dynasty in exchange upholds the people of Shewa."
 tensions_with_the_oromo: "Tensions with the Oromo"
 tensions_with_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo are more than a small issue, they are a contentious ethnic group that often seek to migrate and settle in places that are already inhabited by others, especially Amhara people akin to our own. We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature. They've caused issues for us and other Amhara states in the past, we will learn from their failures in this area."
 defense_over_offense: "Defense over Offense"
 defense_over_offense_desc: "The inherent position of Shewa makes defensive strategies more viable and conquest of the land harder. At times the people here have been isolated from the rest of the region and at other times they have been connected somewhat, but the fact remains that defensive placements and a defensive mentality are key to the survival of Shewa."
 religious_deliberation: "Religious Deliberation"
 religious_deliberation_desc: "Navigating the waters of religious tension in the region Shewa finds itself in is no easy matters. Siding with one side or the other will invoke the ire of another side and possible revolts throughout the land or it could invoke retribution from outside the state. Regardless of the dangers, we must be ready to consider carefully the actions we take in the future regarding religion in Shewa, and how we will go about enforcing a state-sponsored religion."

 ENA_ideas_bonus: "Ennarea Ambition"
 against_damot: "Against Damot"
 against_damot_desc: "We have had a tenuous history with the state of Damot and its territorial ambitions. Though they are not what they were before, just like how we have changed over time, Damot's influence still invokes a certain will to fight and will to persevere for those of Ennarea."
 tribute_to_ethiopia: "Tribute to Ethiopia"
 tribute_to_ethiopia_desc: "The mighty Ethiopian Empire towers above Ennarea and has done so for many years now. As one of the foremost contributors of wealth to the empire via tribute, we have gained a certain level of prestige that other states around us lack. Should this tradition stop, that prestige from before will still serve us nicely when we recount our own history."
 the_mikretcho_council: "The Mikretcho Council"
 the_mikretcho_council_desc: "Though the kingship is divine in nature, the king of Ennarea does not rule with absolute authority. The Mikretcho Council is the one with the final say on many things and the king may not veto this decision; the Mikretcho Council also decides who is next in line as the heir to the throne, signifying just how important they are to the power structure of Ennarea."
 gold_and_slave_trade: "Gold and Slave Trade"
 gold_and_slave_trade_desc: "Traditionally we have been great traders of gold and slaves for a variety of political entities in the region and we are known exactly for this by many. We would be wise to use the diplomatic influence to our advantage whenever we can, but as time goes on, we may find that gold makes people talk as opposed to slaves."
 keep_the_divine_kingship: "Keep the Divine Kingship"
 keep_the_divine_kingship_desc: "To preserve the tradition of Ennarea is also to preserve the divine kingship. Without it, we would be set adrift in a sea of religious chaos and political turmoil, easy pickings for our hungry neighbors. Though we may reform the kingship in some manner or form later on, the root of it all shall always remain the same."
 reforming_tribal_polities: "Reforming Tribal Polities"
 reforming_tribal_polities_desc: "Tribal influences are far and wide throughout Ennarea and sometimes these tribal influences are more detrimental than beneficial. Attempting to centralize and reform these tribes into something more cohesive and manageable is what we will need in the future and it is exactly what we will get."
 charting_an_independent_path: "An Independent Path"
 charting_an_independent_path_desc: "We need not look to the might of Ethiopia for guidance when Ennarea's prosperity grows by the day, the week, the month, and the year. Strengthening our internal ties and connections, building roads, establishing infrastructure, and securing our own economic aspect is what will allow Ennarea to chart its own path that is not dictated by the likes of some foreign occupier."

 WLY_ideas_bonus: "Welayta Ambition"
 stability_of_welayta: "Stability of Welayta"
 stability_of_welayta_desc: "Welayta, our kingdom, has been around for centuries without changing much in terms of size. From our defeat in the north centuries ago, we have managed to maintain a viable position in this southern area (in comparison to Ethiopia) for a very long time now. Our stability here is what gives us strength, and our administration's ability to maintain societal cohesion in Welayta is what continues to keep us afloat."
 centuries_of_presence: "Centuries of Presence"
 centuries_of_presence_desc: "With our presence over such a long time, our reputation amongst our neighbors naturally increases... For the most part. Though we still have rivals near our borders, many of our neighbors recognize the great age of the Welayta state and are willing to respect our longevity in the region."
 damot_lineage: "Damot Lineage"
 damot_lineage_desc: "In our past, the legends passed down to us tell of our old kingdom being called 'Damot'. Was this akin to the Damot we know of today? We cannot be sure, but the myth resonates with the Welayta people enough so that the royal court of Welayta is seen as being connected to the one of Damot, granting a sense of reputation that many high-minded people of our home region are attracted to."
 oromo_tensions: "Oromo Tensions"
 oromo_tensions_desc: "Like many other states around us, the Oromo migrations are a source of great tension for Welayta. How others deal with the Oromo is not for us to think about, we simply need to ensure that we can beat them out in a head-to-head conflict. How does one do that? By having a strong-willed and disciplined military that can overcome whatever tactics are employed by the Oromo. To ensure the integrity of the Welayta state, we must be able to fight."
 mitigate_ethnic_tensions: "Mitigate Ethnic Tensions"
 mitigate_ethnic_tensions_desc: "The ethnic makeup of the region has indeed changed since the Oromo migrations. With these changes, we are experiencing societal tension the likes of which aren't used to but that must be dealt with. If we can resettle certain communities to our outer reaches whilst also maintaining the integrity of our inner areas, then we may very well be able to withstand this new era of ethnic tension."
 welayta_survivability: "Welayta Surviabiity"
 welayta_survivability_desc: "With the location of the Welayta heartland, being able to survive in harsh conditions is a natural requirement and something that is found within all Welayta soldiers. We even prepare our troops with training in the rough lands in our outskirts, meaning that they get firsthand experience of what terrain they will be fighting in."
 reform_the_kingdom: "Reforming the Kingdom"
 reform_the_kingdom_desc: "The kingdom has lasted a very long time with peaceful and terible times mixed in throughout its life but still it remains alive. Reforms and people ready to reform are needed for Welayta to survive even longer and we will be looking to hire such people who can help push through forward-minded legislation in the decades to come."

 AST_ideas_bonus: "Astrakhani Ambition"
 against_the_golden_horde: "Against the Golden Horde"
 against_the_golden_horde_desc: "Breaking away from the Golden Horde and its remnant state, the Great Horde, is no small feat. It takes courage and strength to renounce the old ways of leadership and to begin forging a new path on our own, but with this strength in our hearts and minds, the soldiers and civilians of Astrakhan will go forth and paint a new and brighter future for the region soon enough."
 intersection_of_trade_routes: "Intersection of Trade Routes"
 intersection_of_trade_routes_desc: "The many trade routes that come from all directions intersect at the end of the Volga River as it flows into the Caspian Sea. Our land is one of opportunity and mercantile matters just as much as military affairs and we would be foolish to not capitalize on both. The latter, however, is inherent within Astrakhan, but capitalizing on trade? That is something we will certainly need to work on as time goes by."
 structured_feudal_ranks: "Structured Feudal Ranks"
 structured_feudal_ranks_desc: "Unlike some other khanates, Astrakhan has an ordered and structured social hierarchy that is maintained internally, not by some overlord nation from afar. With this in mind, we can and should integrate new people into this system as time goes on so that they are productive in our land, rather than wandering beggars."
 a_volatile_region: "Our Volatile Region"
 a_volatile_region_desc: "Though there is great opportunity in our region, there is also a great amount of warfare present within it and the successor states to the Golden Horde know this all too well. We of Astrakhan are keen on seeing this period of conflict through to the end despite what our past series of wars and conflicts have indicated; there must be peace and prosperity and our military will fight for this goal without end."
 placate_the_nogais: "Placate the Nogai"
 placate_the_nogais_desc: "A sizable portion of our population are not just Astrakhani, but rather related kin of ours called the Nogai. Though we are family, that does not mean there are not familial tensions between us and often times this has broken out into revolts against our authority in the past. In the future, we need to work on placating and cooperating with our Nogai brothers and sisters instead of forcing them into one single path; cooperation with them can and most likely will lead to more internal stability both in the military and in civilian life."
 become_a_bastion_for_islam: "Becoming an Islamic Bastion"
 become_a_bastion_for_islam_desc: "Islam has its roots far to our south and has reached to the Volga River via conquest and voluntary conversions, but to the north are Christians intent on converting Islamic communities at any cost. As we are the forefront of Islam's spread northward we should strive to become a bastion of the faith and build up our capital to be a center of Islamic learning and culture. If we can do this over time, we will see a rise in faithful adherents coming to our land to aid us in our many endeavors."
 succeed_the_old_khans: "Succeed the Old Khans"
 succeed_the_old_khans_desc: "The ways of the old khans, those of the Golden Horde, the Ilkhanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and the Yuan Dynasty, are gone. No longer can we rely on their traditions of the past to guide us into the dense fog of the future; instead, we must rely on our own skills, abilities, and intuition, making a new path for our leaders and officials. Let out people no longer walk the path of our ancestors, for that path has ended. Now begins the new path, that of Astrakhan."
 
 QAS_ideas: "Qasimi Ideas"
 QAS_ideas_start: "Qasimi Traditions"
 QAS_ideas_bonus: "Qasimi Ambition"
 muscovite_influences: "Muscovite Influences"
 muscovite_influences_desc: "The influences from our north have seeped into the everyday lives of Qasimi people. Though they are firmly Tatar in culture and ethnicity, ways of governing and administrating the land have become somewhat 'Russified' and as such are taking on a mixed form. This has the result of making politics somewhat easier to handle and it is also resulting in a more flexible administration which is something Qasim will undoubtedly need in the future."
 ryazan_memories: "Ryazani Memories"
 ryazan_memories_desc: "The Principality of Ryazan once held the land we now hold as our own, but the memories of them still hold weight with us. A distinctly non-Russian yet simultaneously somewhat Russian state at the edge of what has traditionally seen as the lands of the Rus, that is what Qasim now holds itself as... For now, at least."
 avenues_for_expansion: "Avenues for Expansion"
 avenues_for_expansion_desc: "When swept away of political boundaries on maps, the land we are situated has few natural borders aside from rivers; mostly flat land for roaming and grazing is what Qasim is used to seeing. As such, this land can easily be conquered on paper, that is. Actually doing so is another matter entirely and we will need extensive measures in the Qasimi administration to afford these conquered lands. With the partially Russified and flexible administration we have, it should not be that large of an endeavor."
 kazan_rivalry: "The Kazan Rivalry"
 kazan_rivalry_desc: "The Kazan Khanate is the one that is perhaps our greatest rival, or has been in the past. Strong in leadership and military skill, they have proven time and time again that Qasim needs to rebuff and strengthen its military whenever possible. It, the Qasimi military, must learn and revise old tactics and strategies used by the ancestors of the past and be ready to integrate newer military practices whenever possible."
 lands_of_a_buffer_state: "Lands of a Buffer State"
 lands_of_a_buffer_state_desc: "Similar to how Ryazan was a sort of buffer state between the khans of the south and the lands of the Rus to the north, Qasim is put into a somewhat similar position. Though the lands may be that of a buffer state in the eyes of neighboring powers, these are the lands by which the Qasimi call home and will defend to the very end. This has diplomatic benefits too as neighboring states may be inclined to gain influence over these 'buffer lands', but we will be sure to not let them diplomatically subjugate us."
 reformed_administrative_leadership: "Reformed Administrative Leadership"
 reformed_administrative_leadership_desc: "With our administration coming along nicely and the Qasimi realm becoming a more potent force in the field of diplomacy and on the field of battle, we should be inclined toward reforming the central administration itself into a more robust and meritocratic system. Noble blood has its place within Qasim, but we cannot deny that education and skills in specific areas are making for outstanding individuals in Qasim, some of whom could certainly benefit the state as a whole if we were to hire them."
 defend_tatar_statehood: "Defend Tatar Statehood"
 defend_tatar_statehood_desc: "As we have threats from all directions still, a Tatar state is becoming a real idea in the minds of many in Qasim, but in the minds of some our neighbors? It is a foul thought that should be stamped out at once! Constantly under threat of military invasion of political intervention, the Qasimi people need to stand tall against these threats and show discipline in the face of abhorrent evil! Statehood will be achieved for Qasim and the Tatar people and there will be a valiant defense of it no matter what!"
 
 BSH_ideas: "Bashkir Ideas"
 BSH_ideas_start: "Bashkir Traditions"
 BSH_ideas_bonus: "Bashkir Ambition"
 from_the_tiele: "From the Tiele"
 from_the_tiele_desc: "The Bashkirs date back to the times of the anciete Tiele, a confederation of nomadic tribes that emerged after the ancient Xiongnu confederation of tribes broke up entirely. With such an ancient lineage, we are able to earn respect and honor amongst our neighbors who also recount stories from so long ago."
 sunni_horde_conquest: "Sunni Conquests"
 sunni_horde_conquest_desc: "Much like our neighbors down south, except for perhaps the Persians, conquest by Sunni states is something that almost comes naturally. Despite sayings of piety and religious doctrine here and there, the steppe know few such laws in reality and the Bashkirs will readily take advantage of both this fact and the legacy of Sunni Muslims conquering great swaths of land in the name of Islam and for themselves."
 holders_for_centuries: "Holders for Centuries"
 holders_for_centuries_desc: "For centuries we have resided where we are, not budging and remaining resolute despite what is thrown at us. Military traditions from our ancestors do not go unknown by any Bashkir fighter or military leader and as such they continue to fight with the same ferocity that our ancestors once did."
 turkic_language_intelligibility: "Turkic Language Intelligibility"
 turkic_language_intelligibility_desc: "Our language is mutually intelligible with several other Turkic languages to a degree, and while we can't understand every single thing our cousins say to us, the fact that we can understand a good amount between us goes a long way toward acceptance and tolerance. The more Turkic kin we come into contact with, the better!"
 bashkir_military_tradition: "Bashkir Military Traditions"
 bashkir_military_tradition_desc: "The militarized mentality of the Bashkirs should not be wasted in the slightest. The zeal with which our people fight when defending the land and when they are among the conquering forces of a different land is unparalleled. We should utilize this zeal for more concrete purposes such as expanding the military sector as a whole and ensuring that it has the best possible chance for success against our enemies."
 traditional_steppe_warfare: "Traditional Steppe Warfare"
 traditional_steppe_warfare_desc: "Despit the introduction of firearms, we still prefer the old ways of cavalry armies and tactics. Bashkirs know just how devastating a cavalry charge along with ranged cavalry tactics can be, especially on the wide open steppe, which is why we still utilize them to this day. In any flat terrain setting, our forces will be sure to have the edge against our foes."
 a_formal_bashkir_military: "Formalize the Fighting Force"
 a_formal_bashkir_military_desc: "With such a strong and grand military foundation, the logical next step is to formalize and standardize the Bashkirs into a fully capable fighting force on par with our neighbors. They may think the Bashkirs can't field that large of an army from the lands of the steppe, but we will prove them wrong."

 SHY_ideas_start: "Uzbek Traditions"
 SHY_ideas_bonus: "Uzbek Ambition"
 reign_over_many_tribes: "Rulership over several Tribes"
 reign_over_many_tribes_desc: "The vast part of the steppe that we claim as the Uzbek domain is full of different tribes whose loyalty, at times, is questionable at best. They do, however, have connection toward different regions where different rulers and khans live; through these tribal ties, we can bolster our own name and reputation from the ground up."
 degrading_golden_horde_influence: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc: "Authority from the west is no longer what it used to be. The Slavic people of Muscovy and Novgorod are actively making attempts to take over what land was part of the Golden Horde, similar to us in the east. The waning authority also gives us more freedom to govern our realm as we see fit; we no longer need to pay tribute or service to a ruler from so far away in the west who was often dealing with much more pressing matters."
 contest_over_southern_lands: "Southern Conflicts"
 contest_over_southern_lands_desc: "Land in Transoxiana was always rightfully part of the greater Shaybanid domain, but the likes of Timur and his people contested these claims and sought to tear it away. If we are to keep our claim to being the rightful heir the Shaybanid domain, these conflicts in the south must result in Uzbek victory in time."
 settle_issues_with_tribes: "Settle our Internal Issues"
 settle_issues_with_tribes_desc: "The many tribes within the Shaybanid domain are not always peaceful and often times disputes between them, or disputes with them and the governing body, result in often bloody feuds that can destabilize entire parts of our nation. It is time that we organize formal places (buildings, perhaps) where representatives or leaders of tribes meet to discuss and mediate problems they have with each other. The results are bound to shed less blood, much less than prior ones before, at least."
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain: "Consolidate the Shaybanid Domain"
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain_desc: "The vast stretches of land we rule across have towns and villages dotting the landscape. They may be few and far between, but we can make them the starting points of proper Uzbek settlments that we can either properly tax or draft soldiers from. It is a matter of centralization over decentralization."
 abulkharids: "The Abulkharids"
 abulkharids_desc: "The Abulkharids are a distinct branch of the larger Shaybanid Dynasty and one of its most famous rulers, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, helped solidify Uzbek dominance across the larger Shaybanid domain. It is through the Abulkharids that we find a solid foundation for unity and strength, and it is by them that at least part of our people are held together."
 ascend_from_nomadic_life: "Ascend from Nomadic Life"
 ascend_from_nomadic_life_desc: "The way of the steppe nomads is not what is used to be. Increasingly there are institutions and nations propagating said institutions that chip away at the foundation of our ancestors way of life. Perhaps it is time for the Uzbek people to settle down and start a new life as a more agrarian people, rather than a nomadic people."
 
 KZH_ideas: "Kazakh Ideas"
 KZH_ideas_start: "Kazakh Traditions"
 KZH_ideas_bonus: "Kazakh Ambition" 
 janibek_and_kerei_khan: "Janibek and Kerei Khan"
 janibek_and_kerei_khan_desc: "The two instrumental figures that spearheaded our move for independence from the Uzbek Khanate are still highly revered amongst the Kazakh people today. Our military also looks to them for inspiration at times, using the shock tactics they once used in order to train more effectively and fight with greater efficency."
 struggling_for_steppe_control: "Steppe Control"
 struggling_for_steppe_control_desc: "Wresting control of the steppe is never an easy task, not since the great Mongol Empire fell some time ago. Though we are not the best candidate to take hold of the chaotic region that we call home, we can refine ourselves and prove our worth in this effort."
 fall_of_the_golden_horde: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 fall_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "With the fall of the Golden Horde to the west, power in Central Asia is scattered and people are looking for strong leadership wherever it presents itself. The Kazakh people and its leaders are just such a source, and if cultivate our power just right, the people of Central Asia and maybe even beyond will dutifully obey us."
 rivals_to_our_east: "Rivals to our East"
 rivals_to_our_east_desc: "The east was home to the Chagatai and the Great Yuan, but now there merely hollow remnants in their place. Still, these remnants hold vestiges of power from their predecessors and are still our rivals, meaning we must take proper action against them and bring their banners under our own, uniting their people with the Kazakh people."
 cultures_of_the_steppe: "Cultures of the Steppe"
 cultures_of_the_steppe_desc: "The vast realm that is the steppe is home to a myriad of different languages and cultures, many of which see each other as rivals and enemies. If we can unify them under one banner and proclaim a common mission between them all, we can possible unite them and bolster our manpower reserves as well as our cultural unity."
 expanding_our_internal_domain: "Expanding Our Domain"
 expanding_our_internal_domain_desc: "Within the lands of the Kazakh, there are those who obey the leaders with little question, and those who hear very little from the leaders at all. Let us bring those who are far from the central authority of the Kazakh people closer in so that they too may listen to what the leaders in our administration say and put forth into law."
 modernize_our_tactics: "Modernize our Tactics"
 modernize_our_tactics_desc: "Time and time again, we are seeing the tactics of old run into issues against the modern weapons used predominantly by Europeans and those they trade with. Perhaps investing time and effort into modernization efforts for our military could yield positive results; our old tactics may be kept in books and documents for future use, but if the Kazakh military is to keep itself afloat, there must be some effort to reform and the military itself."

 NOG_ideas_bonus: "Nogai Ambition"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols: "Confederation of Turkic and Mongol Tribes"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols_desc: "The Nogai Horde was originally a gathering and eventual confederation of about 18 Turkic and Mongol tribes. They formed a powerful and distinct force in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and presented a serious challenge to regional authority from the likes of the Golden Horde."
 the_manghits: "The Manghits"
 the_manghits_desc: "The Manghits were a Mongol tribe that formed a foundational core for our people. Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay: "Centralize the Nogai People"
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc: "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."
 weak_religious_institutions: "Weak Religious Institutions"
 weak_religious_institutions_desc: "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of Mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."
 khanate_rivalries: "Khanate Rivals"
 khanate_rivalries_desc: "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control. The Nogai Horde, however, can actively challenge these claims to authority and fight them over legitimacy on the steppe that we inhabit. There may only be one with absolute authority out in our homeland, all others are and will be either rivals or subjects!"
 keep_nomadic_traditions: "Keep our Nomadic Traditions"
 keep_nomadic_traditions_desc: "Our nomadic origins aren't easy to change or get rid of; the act of raiding and pillaging hostile land and bringing back loot to our tribes is something we inherited and something we cannot and will not simply give up."
 fluid_political_organization: "Fluid Political Organization"
 fluid_political_organization_desc: "Due to our spread out population and vast, open territory, politics in the Nogai Horde is much more akin to that of flowing water that rarely impeded by blockages, whereas we see kingdoms and empires around us that encounter countless issues with centralized governments and numerous advisors. If anything, the way we conduct our politics will help keep our people loyal and content."

 SIB_ideas_bonus: "Sibirian Ambition"
 shaybanid_contestment: "Contest the Shaybanid"
 shaybanid_contestment_desc: "The Shaybanids of the south have been a thorn in our side for years upon years without end, but as their domain changes, so does ours. When the Shaybanid domain falls and when other domains fall to our south, it will be our job to pick up the pieces after."
 ostyak_and_sibirian_land: "Ostyak and Sibirian Land"
 ostyak_and_sibirian_land_desc: "The land of the Ostyak and Sibirian people is harsh, cold, and undeveloped when compared to the southern lands. Our home villages in these lands  hidden away whilst our enemies seek it out when they invade, and whilst they roam around, they will feel the cold touch of winter bind them into an icy grave."
 islam_and_shamanism: "Islam and Shamanism"
 islam_and_shamanism_desc: "We are by far the northern-most political entity in which Islam is the dominant religion, but we must realize that indigenous Shamanist beliefs of the northern people are prominent within our domain. We must not be so readily discriminatory toward them as that will only bring about instability to the entire realm; rather, we should be tolernat and understanding to them, slowly coercing them to being one with Islam over time."
 interconnected_mongol_dynasties: "Interconnected Dynasties"
 interconnected_mongol_dynasties_desc: "Throughout the many lands that the once might Mongol Empire conquered, the descendants are now split into several different but still related dynasties. Even we in the far north are connected to this web of dynastic descendants and it is because of this that we can easily enforce our authority over the lands we conquer throughout the steppe and beyond."
 forest_fighting_methods: "Forest Fighting Methods"
 forest_fighting_methods_desc: "The nature of fighting in the far north has made us change our tactics somewhat from how the steppe hordes would normally do combat. Because of the dense forests of the far north, we are more adept at breaking huge cavalry charges and breaking down general shock tactics that some would be used to."
 cogent_relations_with_the_mirzas: "The Mirzas of Sibir"
 cogent_relations_with_the_mirzas_desc: "The nobles of our land, the Mirzas, are needed to maintain control over the wide open land. Though we don't have sprawling urban settlements, we do have sizeable settlements that require local authorities to enforce control over them so that we can maintain unity and stability throughout."
 assimilation_of_siberians: "Assimilation of Siberians"
 assimilation_of_siberians_desc: "They aren't seen as the most capable fighters, but we know we can outfit them with the equipment they need. Siberians come into and out of our land regularly and sometimes look for work, who says we can't pay them to fight for us when we need them most?"

 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc: "Throughout the mid-2nd century, the Sima Clan made its way through the administrative structure of the dominant Wei Kingdom and effectively seized control of the throne of Wei in 266 via Sima Yan. After this, the Jin Dynasty became a dominant force in Chinese affairs and the last bastion of resistance, that of Eastern Wu, was conquered in 280. It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."
 lodged_administrative_divisions: "Lodged Administrative Divisions"
 lodged_administrative_divisions_desc: "A key feature of the Jin Dynasty was that of the administrative divisions developed by the Eastern Jin. They not helped govern some of the more hard-to-reach places of Southern China, but they also helped structure the government of the Jin Dynasty in a way that helped alleviate pressure from different internal sources. It would do us good to bring back these administrative divisions so that we too can profit from a more refined form of government."
 battle_against_former_qin: "The Former Qin"
 battle_against_former_qin_desc: "The Former Qin was the main opposition to the Eastern Jin from about 351 - 394, up until the Battle of the Fei River (383). Such a victory for the Jin Dynasty not only helped with legitimacy, but it also secured the rest of China from the imposters. We would do well to remember this battle and this victory well, for it was perhaps one of our greatest moments in history."
 manipulation_of_taoism: "Manipulate Taoism"
 manipulation_of_taoism_desc: "Taoism is often present in more rural communities around China, whereas Confucianism is seen to be present in the administrative structure of China. Just as our ancestors did, we should take a keen interest in Taoism and how it helps run these more rural societies for, if we can manipulate the people through Taoism (and vice-versa), we can ensure that our outskirts are stable and secure."
 war_of_the_eight_princes: "War of the Eight Princes"
 war_of_the_eight_princes_desc: "The period of civil rebellion from 291 to 306, known to us as the 'War of the Eight Princes', took place due to contention over the regency of Emperor Hui of Jin (he was developmentally disabled). Though this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."
 the_five_barbarians: "The Five Barbarians"
 the_five_barbarians_desc: "Those that came through and overthrew the Western Jin, they defiled us once before but we will never let this happen again. The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 ancient_shu_state: "Ancient Shu State"
 ancient_shu_state_desc: "Long ago, the people of the Sichuan Basin formed an independent kingdom and remained independent up until they were annexed by the Qin state (precursor to the Qin Dynasty). Our people have not forgotten that their heritage stretched so far back and is distinct from those outside of the Sichuan Basin nor have others around China."
 shu_han: "Shu Han"
 shu_han_desc: "Liu Bei of the Three Kingdoms period declared the state of Shu the rightful successor to the Han Dynasty, giving it more legitimacy in the eyes of those who were loyal to the Han Dynasty at the time. We have not forgotten this proclamation and even though the Han Dynasty is but a mere chapter in the history of China, we still see ourselves as the rightful and legitimate rulers of China."
 three_kingdoms_period_shu: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc: "Pivotal in the history of the Sichuan people and the state of Shu in general, the Three Kingdoms period saw the establishment of an independent Shu state by Liu Bei in 221. It was here that Shu was immortalized into history and it is here from which we today draw inspiration, unification, and lessons from."
 zhuge_liang: "Zhuge Liang"
 zhuge_liang_desc: "After the death of Liu Bei in 223, his heir, Liu Shan took to the throne at age 16 with Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents overseeing most of the administration. Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."
 defensive_position: "Defensive Position"
 defensive_position_desc: "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending. This was clearly evident during the Three Kingdoms period since attacks from Shu required more effort and resources as opposed to defensive encounters. We would do well to remember this fact and fortify our defenses where and when possible."
 connections_through_trade: "Trade Connections"
 connections_through_trade_desc: "A key fact of the Sichuan Basin and when the Shu state came to prominence in the early to mid-3rd century was the conenctions through trade. South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."

 history_of_independence_desc: "The history of the region that is Wu and its independence stretches to before the 10th century BC. Military history as well as political and diplomatic history was forged both inside of and on the borders of the Wu region, leading to a fairly well defined sub-culture of China that still surges with power."
 waters_of_wu: "The Waters of Wu"
 waters_of_wu_desc: "The coastal waters are where much of the imports and exports of Wu go through. As such, it is only natural that we seek to protect these waters with a robust and large navy."
 three_kingdoms_period: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_desc: "The Three Kingdoms period was perhaps one of the most defining periods in the history of the Wu region since it marked it's last echo of independence until the 10th century AD. The military, cultural markers, and societal aspects of this time period are not lost on our people and we will continue to bask in the glory that was Eastern Wu."
 promote_coastal_trade: "Promote Coastal Trade"
 promote_coastal_trade_desc: "The ports of Wu grow in size and importance as time goes on. Some of the most important ports in China are found in our land, so why not capitalize on it and help grow our revenue sector via trade?"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period: "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom Period"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc: "The state of Wuyue, founded in 907 by Qian Liu, was perhaps the most powerful of the southern states of this chaotic time period after the Tang Dynasty. During its independence until 978, many infrastructure projects were put into motion and the land of Wu was greatly developed, leading to even more value coming to the region."
 the_sun_dynasty: "The Sun Dynasty"
 the_sun_dynasty_desc: "True to our history, the Sun Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms Period held the dominant position despite succession struggles clouding the future of Wu.

 foundation_in_myths_desc: "From the legends in Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian', the royal family of Chu was descended from the Yellow Emperor (also known as Huangdi) and his grandson/successor Zhuanxu. Though the tale of the royal family's birth is longer than this in its entirety, our connections to traditional Chinese myths and deities gives us prestige in the eyes of those in and outside our state."
 control_over_central_china: "Control over Central China"
 control_over_central_china_desc: "The fertile region of Central China holds plenty of potential for agriculture, and a large population by natural consequences. Chu's foundation in the region makes it ideal for expansion by fielding a large military from places that are easier to develop and manage. We must keep in line with this way of thinking and continue to build up urban centers throughout Chu so that we do not falter in our military or economic potential"
 the_spring_autumn_period: "The Spring and Autumn Period"
 the_spring_autumn_period_desc: "The decline in authority from the Eastern Zhou throughout the the latter 700's BC was the rallying call for the Chu state and many others. As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."
 take_on_gov_corruption: "Take on Government Corruption"
 take_on_gov_corruption_desc: "One aspect of the government of Chu was how corrupt it was at times. Administrators in both the military and the government were often doing secret deals or taking bribes that none could stop. If we are to be successful in our administrative tasks and military organization, there needs to be a stricter stance on corruption and more severe punishments for those found responsible for corrupt ties."
 qin_chu_rivalry: "Qin-Chu Rivarly"
 qin_chu_rivalry_desc: "Our most ardent and deadly rival was the legalist state of Qin. Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."
 stop_internal_decadence: "Stop Internal Decadence"
 stop_internal_decadence_desc: "A main facet of our culture in the Spring and Autumn Period and in the subsequent Warring States Period was just how relaxed and laid-back our culture was, so much so that it began to affect society on a much larger scale. Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors. There can be art and pleasure in our culture, but Chu must remain an efficient and robust state at all levels."

Let us use this to our advantage as we go forth."
 cultural_works_of_qi: "Cultural Works of Qi"
 cultural_works_of_qi_desc: "The cultural works of our ancestors are still evident today.

 learn_from_the_northern_qi: "Learn from the Northern Qi"
 learn_from_the_northern_qi_desc: "Much like the Southern Qi, the Northern Qi was plagued with issues during its short time in the mid-6th century.

 lessons_of_the_southern_qi: "Lessons of the Southern Qi"
 lessons_of_the_southern_qi_desc: "Much like the Northern Qi, the Southern Qi was rife with problems, chief among which were rebellions and corruption at all levels of government. The arbitrary executions carried out and curtailing of certain officials for menial reasons must be learned from, for the banners of Qi must not be stained with horrid acts that destroy the nation from the inside out."
 reformation_of_military_ranks: "Reformation of Military Ranks"
 reformation_of_military_ranks_desc: "Cleaning up the mess that is the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, and the military ranks of Qi are something that will be needed in order to help clean up said mess. Reforming them and instituting long lasting military education into our armies will help achieve smarter and more effective military minds that will, in time, instill discipline into our armies."
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court: "Cultivate a Cohesive Court"
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court_desc: "The court of Qi is the central part of matters where things can and have gone wrong in the past.

 zhang_xianzhong_yellow_tiger_desc: "Our founder, though brutal in his methods, was the one who instilled the spirit of rebellion into the people of Daxi.

Chinese territory is being continuously locked down and away from us thanks to these innovations, so what do we of Daxi need to do? Bolster our siege ability to counter what the enemies are doing!"
 from_chengdu_to_xijing: "From Chengdu to Xijing"
 from_chengdu_to_xijing_desc: "Though Chengdu is often seen as merely a western trade hub near those of Tibet and Yunnan, it is much more than that. Being fertile for agriculture and the place where our rebellions began, it will serve as our spiritual and administrative capital, and will be proclaimed as 'Xijing', or, Western Capital."
 cut_down_opposition: "Cut Down Opposition"
 cut_down_opposition_desc: "The rebellious people that think they would overthrow the Daxi Dynasty are foolish in their thoughts and attempts. Some would defect to the defunct Ming Dynasty or to other lords, but they know not what they do or what they say. We will teach them through force that loyalty to the Daxi Dynasty is rewarded, and opposition will absolutely be cut down."

 the_question_of_ming_succession_desc: "The Ming Dynasty is but a fleeting dream in the minds of several groups of people in both peasant and noble circles. Those of Ning are some of the most keen on seeing this declining dynasty that does not deserve the Mandate of Heavean turned into paper and ink on the shelves of history, and we are only all too happy to proclaim that the question of who will succeed the Ming Dynasty, will be those of Ning."
 zhu_chenhao: "Zhu Chenhao"
 zhu_chenhao_desc: "Zhu Chenhao is the one who began sentiments about the waning Ming Dynasty's authority and lack of proper succession for the throne, and he was the one who attempted to seize it for himself. Though he might have failed, his legacy lives on in us, those of Ning that still rule from the area in and around Nanchang and who are still keen on seeing those of proper Chinese culture thrive and prosper."
 coercion_leads_to_deals: "Coercion and Deals"
 coercion_leads_to_deals_desc: "Part of how Zhu Chenhao got his start in garnering support for his cause was through bribery and backroom deals with various officials in and around the Chinese courts. Though some find these tactics distasteful, we find them to be part of the overall grand strategy that is needed in order to claim what power rightfully belongs to Ning."
 claiming_or_making_the_throne: "Claiming or Making the Throne"
 claiming_or_making_the_throne_desc: "The throne of the Ming Dynasty is seen by many to be riddled with flaws and corruption, lacking in what it takes to truly be something that can hold the Mandate of Heaven. The question then comes to us: Do we claim the throne and polish it in order to put proper order in where the previous emperors once faltered, or do we make a new throne for ourselves and proclaim a new age? Regardless of which we choose, our military zeal will ensure that we are successful in reaching this point, for Ning can be the only true successor in the Middle Kingdom."
 core_at_nanchang: "Core at Nanchang"
 core_at_nanchang_desc: "Nanchang is not only fertile ground for agriculture and commerce, but it is also ready for infrastructure developments that we, the administrators of Ning, are ready to fund. Those of the Ming Dynasty are too busy with corrupt ways and other areas to deal with Nanchang, but we are more than willing to heed the needs of its people and soon enough, the other people we will grow to encompass."
 widespread_support: "Widespread Support"
 widespread_support_desc: "The support for Ning is becoming more and more prevalent. Those of Nanchang that were once staunch activists against us are becoming sympathetic to our cause, and those who rallied to our cause at first are spreading the fervor elsewhere.

 centuries_of_warfare: "Centuries of Warfare"
 centuries_of_warfare_desc: "Military conquest was nothing new to us when we held the Mandate of Heaven and it evolved during our time in the spotlight. In the time since we've been away, however, innovations have been had that we must incorporate actively into our own military if we are to become a true military force once more. Warfare changes, and with it, so must be, adapting with and improving upon what new technologies come about for our soldiers."

 cultivate_the_3_departments_6_ministries_desc: "The system enstated by the Sui Dynasty that comprised of three departments underneath the emperor, and six ministries underneath the central Department of State Affairs.

 claiming_tribute_and_subjects: "Claiming Tribute; Claiming Subjects"
 claiming_tribute_and_subjects_desc: "Various states outside the actual borders of the Tang Dynasty were often tributaries and subjects of us. It was and still is considered a great honor and a show of power to have such subjects and we are only all too willing to once again flaunt our power in this way. Who knows, perhaps the old rulers of these far off places we once influenced remember our englightened way of thinking and rulership?"
 building_upon_old_military_structures: "Building upon Military Tradition"
 building_upon_old_military_structures_desc: "The military of the Tang Dynasty in our past is long gone, nowhere to be seen or heard of. The foundations by which they built off of, however, are still around for us to use for future endeavors, and we will need to use them if we are to keep up in terms of embracing and utilizing new and upcoming technologies for our soldiers."
 dominating_trade_sectors: "Dominating Trade Sectors"
 dominating_trade_sectors_desc: "We were the preeminent holders of the eastern and central parts of the Silk Road when we holders of the Mandate of Heaven. Trade regions within our domain and just outside of it were affected by our trade policies and how we regulated the goods going along it. Though new trade routes have opened in this new age of opportunity, we are still more than able to adapt and put our trade knowledge to use, taking what revenue is rightfully ours."

 reclaim_the_lost_glory_desc: "The age of our ancestors is long gone, only to be remembered from the brush strokes painted onto paper and from the sayings of our fathers and mothers. In these turbulent times, politics have shifted and a new age is upon the people of the Tang Dynasty, an age that will see them reclaim what they lost so long ago. No longer will they stand by and watch pretender after pretender seize the throne of the Middle Kingdom, corrupting it further with each new ruler; we will restore the balance of power, and reclaim what glory we lost so long ago."

 an_lushan_rebellion_desc: "Due to the decadent Tang Dynasty, instability grew throughout the entirety of the land. Thanks in part to An Lushan's great connections and influence within the Tang Dynasty, his proclamation of rebellion and the eventualy Great Yan Dynasty were heard throughout the land of the Middle Kingdom, gathering several people from all walks of life to the cause."
 merchant_class_insurgents: "Merchant Class Insurgents"
 merchant_class_insurgents_desc: "Part of the rebellion was started by merchants disguised to infiltrate various echelons of society and infrastructure to gather support. Though not unheard of, we would be wise to continue using merchants in our underhanded measures since it continues to work for us."
 prosperous_northern_roots: "Prosperous Northern Roots"
 prosperous_northern_roots_desc: "We hail from the northern parts of the Middle Kingdom, renowned for its fertility in agriculture and prosperity as a hot spot for urban growth. By cultivating the image and the memory of the Great Yan Dynasty in the hearts and minds of the northern people, we can obtain a steady stream of recruits willing to fight for us, and with this in mine, perhaps we can soon spread our message into other parts fo the Middle Kingdom."
 revise_succession_laws: "Revise Succession Laws"
 revise_succession_laws_desc: "One of the key factors that undercut An Lushan and his rebellion after he proclaimed the Great Yan Dynasty was the matter of succession, for his son did end up killing him in the end, causing a major succession struggle to ensue. What we need is a reformation of succession laws and how our heirs rank in comparison to each other so that we do not suffer what An Lushan did."
 soldiers_from_many_regions: "Soldiers from many Regions"
 soldiers_from_many_regions_desc: "Part of the nature of An Lushan's rebellion was that it was multi-ethnic. People from as far as away as Sogdia came to fight for his side and Arabs fought alongside Chinese soldiers as mercenaries in the entire struggle. As such, we will cultivate a diverse military just like he did and though we may have to pay a little extra to do this, it will work to bring greater prosperity through defense and offense to the Great Yan Dynasty."

 after_the_tang_dynasty_desc: "The old and decaying Tang Dynasty was dying when our founder, Emperor Taizu, overthrew the last remaining parts and established the Later Liang. His actions may have brought about the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but there was merit and there were reasons as to why he did so and we live on in the hopes that we can see his ambitions through to the end."
 ambition_for_luoyang_and_changan: "Ambition for Luoyang and Chang'an"
 ambition_for_luoyang_and_changan_desc: "The twin capitals of the Tang Dynasty were Luoyang and Chang'an. By exerting influence and eventual direct control over both historic centers of administration and power, those of the Liang Dynasty may rise to become even more powerful and prepared for more ambitious conquests in the Middle Kingdom."

 from_kaifeng_outwards_desc: "The foundational power for the Later Liang was at Kaifeng and Emperor Taizu and his son, Emperor Mo, attempted to cultivate it to become a place where the Later Liang could exert power from. If we put enough time and effort into making Kaifeng into just such a place where the Liang Dynasty is known as the true and legitimate holder of the Mandate of Heaven, then we will be well on our way to claiming the whole of the Middle Kingdom for ourselves."
 memories_of_the_southern_tang: "Memories of the Southern Tang"
 memories_of_the_southern_tang_desc: "Inept military measures and internal struggles became our downfall under Emperor Mo as the Southern Tang conquered our territory in its bid to reform the Tang Dynasty once more. It is through this horrible defeat that we will learn from and implement sweeping military reforms that are aimed at targeting how inept we once more, and ensuring that the Liang Dynasty will be able to hold out against those who seek to destroy it."
 help_from_the_north: "Northern Help"
 help_from_the_north_desc: "Shatuo Turks were of importance to the Later Liang due to the fact that Emperor Taizu had to maintain tense relations with them since he had a previous rivalry with Li Keyong, governor of Shanxi province. Later on though, the Shatuo Turks proved useful as military aids to various parts of the Middle Kingdom and it is that aid from the northern people that we maintain. The rivalry is gone now, and the Shatuo Turks are but distant memories, yet still a bond of mutual benefits still lingers between the Liang Dynasty and the people from the north."
 warranted_brutality: "Warranted Brutality"
 warranted_brutality_desc: "In an era of chaos and dispute claims to succession and thrones, one must be ruthless in their actions, along with being swift and mindful of the actions to come.

 original_people_of_guangxi_desc: "Of the southwestern part of the Middle Kingdom, where the jungles and hills meet the unforgiving terrain of the Thai, Lao, and Viet people, the Zhuang people lived on. Many find it hard to live here like we have, and those who dare intrude on our land with hostile intent will be like those who have tried before: dying on the ground, crawling against the Zhuang people."
 tenuous_chinese_authority: "Tenuous Chinese Authority"
 tenuous_chinese_authority_desc: "We find ourselves far from any firm authority from the Middle Kingdom itself. Nanjing, the supposed 'southern capital' is so far from us that rarely any Zhuang people have travelled to and from it, recounting it for our people in depth. With this in mind, we are often left to ourselves and governing our land in the ways we have cultivated over the centuries is much better when compared to top-down laws of force by the Chinese from afar."
 remember_the_nanzhao: "Remember the Kingdom of Nanzhao"
 remember_the_nanzhao_desc: "The Tai people and their great kingdom of Nanzhao was something to behold. The Zhuang people looked up to them as they repelled armies from the Chinese in 751 and 754, but we could not do the same, unfortunately. Still, their example of unity amidst the onslaught of Chinese forces glows brightly as an example for our people to follow."
 warrior_women_of_the_zhuang: "Warrior Women of the Zhuang"
 warrior_women_of_the_zhuang_desc: "Unlike other cultures around us, we, the Zhuang, see women as a resource almost as valuable as men in regards to fighting. We train many women in similar ways in which we train men in regards to military matters and as such they are able to earn a better place amongst the clans of the Zhuang people."
 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes: "Ridding ourselves of Tribalism"
 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes_desc: "Perhaps it is a reason as to why our people are so weak at promoting influence beyond Guangxi; tribes and clans from around the area we inhabit are always keen on gaining or usurping power from the others, but anytime this happens, great feuds erupt and atrocities are witnessed that should never happen. It is because of these past experiences that we must learn to transcend them and break the ties that bind us to the tribal networks of the past. It will be tough to do so, but it will be well worth the effort."
 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism: "Refine Moism"
 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism_desc: "The traditional religious practices of the Zhuang people are strange when compared to the Buddhists to the south, or the Confucians in the rest of the Middle Kingdom. Though we have adopted some practices from both regions, Moism is still prevalent in Zhuang society and with it being foundational for our people, there is a sense that it must be refined and cultivated as time goes on. If we do this and actively work to help reform it into a state religion, the Zhuang people may seen unity on yet another level crucial for sustaining a prospering state."

 peace_for_the_zhuang_people_desc: "Though some of our people have lofty ambitions for a great empire spanning to the horizons in all directions, the majority of Zhuang people simply want peace in their lives, free from the authorities from the Middle Kingdom and free from dangers elsewhere.

 shang_yang_promoting_legalism: "Shang Yang's Legalism"
 shang_yang_promoting_legalism_desc: "The type of legalism promoted by Shang Yang to the military and administration of the Qin Dynasty after the Zhou Dynasty fell from grace was the type that made the fighters of our state ruthless and efficient. They showed better discipline and superior tactics as compared to those around them and carried forth military innovations for years to come. It is this legacy that we of the resurgent Qin Dynasty keep to."

 developments_of_the_qin_capital_desc: "Not only did Shang Yang promote legalism to the Qin Dynasty, he also promoted the development of the capital itself through infrastructure investments. It is through this development that he helped garner the loyalty of the people and that he helped make the Qin Dynasty prosper."
 ready_for_military_reforms: "Ready for Military Reforms"
 ready_for_military_reforms_desc: "Part of the strength of the Qin Dynasty was its capability of adopting military reforms and innovations for itself as this proved crucial in the Spring and Autumn Period that preceeded the formalization of the Qin Dynasty. This spirit of adaptation in military matters is something that we are still ready for today as new technologies come to us and our officers."
 strong_political_and_peasent_base: "Strong Political and Citizen Base"
 strong_political_and_peasent_base_desc: "Legalism was foundational to our power, but it alone could not have propelled the Qin Dynasty to prominence. It was the unity sustained in the peasant class and the political class that also helped us gain authority and power and with this unity within us once more, who knows just how much power we can exude against our rivals."
 grand_position_of_the_qin_dynasty: "Grand Position of the Qin Dynasty"
 grand_position_of_the_qin_dynasty_desc: "Thanks in part to more recent technologies, the seat of the Qin Dynasty is fit not only for horse breeding, but also agricultural yields and other resource extractions.

Thus, we migrated over the centuries to where we reside currently, and though we lost many traditions from these migrations, we have gained crucial insight into moving lightly and with haste, something the others around us can't match in the slightest."

 productive_potential_in_the_earth_desc: "There lies potential not in the agriculture of where we live, but rather in the hills and mountains. Precious metals used in various sectors of daily life, from building materials to military weapons, can be found deep within the hills which we claim as our own. By investing effort and time into mining these places, we will see profits for the Hakka people that match what is needed for a prosperous future."

 distinct_chinese_identity_desc: "We are not like the other Chinese around us, and they know this just as well as we do. We speak a different dialect and a perform different rituals and customs that may be similar to their own, but still there are differences that set us apart and leave us vulnerable to persecution, which we have endured for ages without end. Now, though, we may finally fight back and see to it that the Hakka people are not shunned and executed for being simply who they are."

 promote_the_dragon_deities_desc: "Also distinct from the other Chinese people in the Middle Kingdom, the Hakka people are fond of the dragon deities passed down from ages ago. Rarely found elsewhere, the dragon deities help strengthen our faith and worship of our ancestors and we will continue promoting them throughout our land."
 build_toulous: "Tulou, Earthen Buildings"
 build_toulous_desc: "Tulou are traditional communal buildings built by our people for generations and they serve not only as great living spaces, but also partially as defensive structures that can help stave off enemy invasions. If we build upon this mentality and work toward making some tulou into a more defensive structure, perhaps they will prove useful as fortresses in the future. Certainly no one will see these coming as only the Hakka people have built them and readily continue to build them."

 carve_out_a_place_for_the_hakka_desc: "The existence of the Hakka people has been one of turmoil and chaos, full of unrest and persecution from various groups in the Middle Kingdom.

 resisting_central_chinese_authority_desc: "There is a reason why there has never been a dynasty with their capital fixed in the southern parts of the Middle Kingdom, and it is because of how resistant and distinct the south is from the north. Time and time again they have tried to rein us in, but still there is resistance and eventual autonomy given to the Yue people. Now that we are free once more, the others can be sure that they will not have an easy time taking us back into the fold."

 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu_desc: "One of our most famous kings, Goujian, destroyed and annexed the petty state of Wu in 473BC and set an example of just how powerful the southern people of the Middle Kingdom can be. It is partially because of his example that we continue to try to be ready militarily for whatever comes our way, lest we fail and succumb to foreign incursions or internal decadance."

 keepers_of_the_southern_waters_desc: "The waters in the south of the Middle Kingdom are rife with trade from far off places that hold several different goods and resources unique as compared to what is found locally. We must protect these trade routes and water ways from those further north so that the prosperity comes solely to us, and once that is established, naval dominance is a mere small step away."

 connections_to_the_vietnamese_desc: "The Yue people are connected to the Viet people in at least some tangential fashion and this is evident through our history that dates back to the Nanyue Kingdom. By building relations with the Viet people and cultivating prosperous ties with key Viet officials, we can begin to bridge the gap betweent he two people groups and once again fight against the hegemony attempting to be imposed on from the north."
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together: "Blending of Administrations"
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together_desc: "The traditional administative structure of the Middle Kingdom was something foreign to the Yue people before, but as the Nanyue Kingdom became more closely tied to the Han Dynasty, the administration of both became slowly intertwined. By cultivating this blending of administrative methods more and taking the best of both sides, we can effectively govern the Yue people and state through both reformist and traditionalist methods."

 the_great_nanyue_kingdom_desc: "Though seemingly gone from the memory of many, the Nanyue Kingdom is still around in the hearts and minds of several Yue people.

 maritime_investments_desc: "The position of the Min domain is such that maritime affairs are unavoidable. Instead of doing so, we will engage with maritime trade and warfare and seek to dominate it; if we can secure the coastal waters around the Middle Kingdom for ourselves, we will have a much easier time promoting and forcing our access to the interior."

Why not cement this friendship further and accept the mercenaries into our fold?"

 repulse_delhi_and_afghan_invasions_desc: "Pashtun and Hindustani troops alike are keen on taking over Multan at all times, whether by diplomacy or by conquest, neither of which we will readily allow happen.

 from_frontier_land_to_heart_land_desc: "The lands of Multan have changed over the decades and centuries, whether it be in layout of cities, the ways of the culture present within it, or even the religious traditions present within the people living here. They are no longer a frontier land that is simply on the edge of an empire or kingdom of some sort, no, they are now a heartland to a vibrant and prosperous people. We must let none take this away from the Multani people, making this land once again a mere frontier domain."

 the_threat_of_bengal_desc: "The Muslim invasions of the 1000s and to 1200s were some of the most frightening times for the traditional Hindu and Jain states of Northern India.

 FRX_idea_2: "Repel the Saracens"
 FRX_idea_2_desc: "In 721, the Umayyad invasion was halted by the Frankish victory at the Battle of Toulouse, guaranteeing the soverignty of Christendom for centuries to come.

 FRX_idea_3: "Lessons of Charlemagne"
 FRX_idea_3_desc: "Under Chalemagne, the Frankish Empire found great military sucess on several fronts. This was in part due to the Carolingian strategy of emphasizing mobility and encouraging looting to buy the loyality of his nobles. It has long since been the days of yore, but mobility and looting remain remarkably essential on the battlefield."

In order to place limits on the clergy's power in the area the counts founded the city of Montferrand, however this has only served to further intensify the problems of centuries ago. In order to end the rivalry once and for all we should merge the two cities. This would increase Clermont's economic output greatly while also benefitting the clergy."

 MAG_idea_2:0 "Bread House of the Hansa"

It's the Archbishop of Mainz who calls the electors together for an election, who accepts the new Emperor and exercises control over the Reichstag archives. He was formally the most important member of the Reichstag."
 MAI_idea_2:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 MAI_idea_2_desc:0 "The Primas Germaniae was a historical title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic Bishop in the German lands. Many were unsuccessful in claiming the title, but after the Secularization in 1802, Salzburg was able to claim and hold it.\nInterestingly enough, this importance was also reflected in another title: in the Catholic world, there are only two Holy Sees: the Vatican Holy See and the Holy See of Mainz."
 MAI_idea_3:0 "Large Military Household"
 MAI_idea_3_desc:0 "The Archbishop of Mainz maintained one of the largest military households among the ecclesiastical magnates in Medieval Germany.

Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Madgeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5:0 "Brand zu Mainz"
 MAI_idea_5_desc:0 "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertiel territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 MAI_idea_6:0 "Mainz Diocesan Feud"
 MAI_idea_6_desc:0 "After a close election, the Archbishop of Mainz was not recognized by the Pope, who appointed his contender. This eventually became an armed conflict.

 MAI_idea_7:0 "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc:0 "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were many times trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended to obey more to the Elector than to the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had an domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to becoem the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, seeked and managed to gain more power."

In imitation of the Corpus evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor.

During the 13th century they had to contend with the podestas of other families, like Ansidei and Gambacari, but from 1312 they ruled as signori, the lords of the city.
